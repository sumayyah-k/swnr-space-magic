# Stars Without Number Space Magic
This will (hopefully) help track spells and spell slots for classes that use them. This is not really for wide distribution as it's _barely_ integrated with the system.

## How to Use
1. On a character sheet, type in the class as "Arcanist", "Magister", "Pacter", "Rectifier" or "War Mage"
2. Add powers with spell info, name, description and level fields are all that's used right now.
3. highlight token on a map, if the class is set correctly the button to the right of the hotbar will open a spellcasting window

## Installation
Drop the files in a folder named `swnr-space-magic` in foundry's modules directory. Enable from manage modules screen in game.
