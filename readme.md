# Stars Without Number Space Magic
This will (hopefully) help track spells and spell slots for classes that use them. This is not really for wide distribution as it's _barely_ integrated with the system.

[Changelog](https://github.com/sumayyah-k/swnr-space-magic/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## How to Use
1. On a character sheet, type in the class as "Arcanist", "Magister", "Pacter", "Rectifier" or "War Mage"
2. Add powers with spell info, name, description and level fields are all that's used right now.
3. Change the actor sheet to the `swnr-space-magic.MageActorSheet`
4. A new "Magic" tab will be on the sheet where spells and spell slots can be managed and spell can cast.

## Homebrew Mage the Awakening Notes
I added in a bunch of stuff from Mage: The Awakening as a homebrew for use in my home game.

### How to Use
1. Set class to "Mage"
2. Add Skills: "Gnosis", "Death", "Fate", "Forces", "Life", "Matter", "Mind", "Prime", "Space", "Spirit", "Time"
3. Change character sheet to `swnr-space-magic.MageActorSheet`
4. Change "Power" and "Item" item sheet default to `swnr-space-magic.MageItemSheet`, this will allow for mage style spells and yantra items.

## Installation
install from foundry using the manifest URL: https://github.com/sumayyah-k/swnr-space-magic/releases/latest/download/module.json

Drop the files in a folder named `swnr-space-magic` in foundry's modules directory. Enable from manage modules screen in game.
